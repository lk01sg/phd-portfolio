# PhD Portfolio Repository

This repository contains the research workflow, drafts, and resources for my PhD journey.
It is structured to separate data, analysis, manuscripts, and documentation for better organization and reproducibility.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the repository locally:

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lk01sg/phd-portfolio.git
   cd phd-portfolio
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**

   ```bash
   # with conda
   conda env create -f env/environment.yml
   conda activate phd-portfolio

   # or with pip
   pip install -r env/requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run notebooks / analysis**

   * Exploratory notebooks are located in `/notebooks/`
   * Example workflows: `/notebooks/example_workflow.ipynb`

4. **Build documentation / site**

   ```bash
   # depending on the toolchain, e.g., Quarto or MkDocs
   quarto render docs
   ```

## Workflow

* Initial exploration is done in `/notebooks/`; stable components are refactored into `/src/`.
* Raw data goes into `/data/raw/`, processed datasets into `/data/processed/`.
* Outputs such as figures, models, and tables are stored in `/results/`.
* Drafts of papers are stored in `/manuscripts/`.
* Documentation and the public site are built from `/docs/` and published via GitHub Pages:
